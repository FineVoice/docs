## **Your First TTS Request**

Let’s create your first audio file from text.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set your API key">
        Store your API key as an environment variable (recommended approach):

        ```shellscript
        export FINEVOICE_API_KEY="replace_me"
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Make the TTS request">
        > The following example uses the default voice. To use a different voice, change the `voice` parameter and provide the model name from FineVoice. You can retrieve detailed information about available voices using the methods below. [**[View Voice API]**](https://fvdocs.fineshare.com/api-reference/endpoint/getvoicedetail)

        Run this **cURL** command to generate your first voice:

        ```shellscript
        curl -X POST https://converter.fineshare.net/api/fsmstexttospeech \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $FINEVOICE_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
          "Engine": "v7",
          "AppId": "107",
          "FeatureId": "22",
          "speech": "[happy] Hi, welcome to today’s video! In this episode, [breathe] I’ll show you some practical voice generation tips that can make your audio projects a lot easier and more creative. [clear_throat] Stick around, and let’s jump right in!",
          "voice": "james",
          "platform": "web",
          "Parameter": {
            "Speed": 1.0,
            "LanguageCode": "en-US",
            "Pitch": 0.0
          }
        }'\
        ```

        Windows Command Prompt:

        ```shellscript
        curl -X POST https://converter.fineshare.net/api/fsmstexttospeech -H "Authorization: Bearer %FINEVOICE_API_KEY%" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"Engine\":\"v7\",\"AppId\":\"107\",\"FeatureId\":\"22\",\"speech\":\"[happy] Hi, welcome to today’s video! In this episode, [breathe] I’ll show you some practical voice generation tips that can make your audio projects a lot easier and more creative. [clear_throat] Stick around, and let’s jump right in!\",\"voice\":\"james\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"Parameter\":{\"Speed\":1.0,\"LanguageCode\":\"en-US\",\"Pitch\":0.0}}"
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Get the Audio Download URL">
        The response returns a unique `uuid` that identifies the generated audio task.\
        Use this `uuid` in the subsequent request to retrieve the audio download URL.

        ```shellscript
        {
          "uuid": "6d2fec0a-0983-4b3f-b3f8-6038d12187ce",
          "available_count": 298825,
          "wordBoundaries": [],
          "error": {
            "code": "0001",
            "message": null
          }
        }
        ```

        Use the following request to check the file generation status and retrieve the audio download URL:

        ```shellscript
        curl -X GET https://voiceai.fineshare.net/api/checkfilechangestatus/{uuid}
        ```

        Replace `{uuid}` with the `uuid` returned from the text-to-speech request.\
        When the audio file is ready, the response will include the audio download URL.

        **Response Example:**

        ```json
        {
            "uuid": "6d2fec0a-0983-4b3f-b3f8-6038d12187ce",
            "client": null,
            "status": 3,

            "coverUrl": null,
            "duration": 16,
            "title": "welcome to today’s video",
            "error": {

                "message": null
            }
        }
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Download the Audio File">
        Run the following cURL command to download the audio file:

        ```shellscript
        curl -L -o output.mp3 https://dlaudio.fineshare.net/ovc/6d2fec0a-0983-4b3f-b3f8-6038d12187ce.mp3
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Play the Downloaded Audio">
        The audio has been saved as **output.mp3.** You can play it by:

        - Double-clicking the file or opening it in any media player
        - Or using the command line:

        ```shellscript
        # On macOS
